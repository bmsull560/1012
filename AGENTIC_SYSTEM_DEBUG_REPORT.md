## 🐛 Issues Identified

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Limited Code Generation**
   - **Problem**: Most recent PRs have minimal code (7-96 lines)
   - **Expected**: Full implementations with multiple files
   - **Cause**: Complex components may exceed model context/token limits
   - **Impact**: Developers need to manually complete implementations
   - **Status**: **Known Limitation**

2. **Dependency Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: `requirements-ai.txt` lists more packages than workflow uses
   - **Impact**: Documentation inconsistency
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Fix**: Update requirements file or workflow

3. **Local Testing Not Configured**
   - **Problem**: Cannot run agentic system locally (pip not available)
   - **Impact**: Must test via GitHub Actions only
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Test changes in workflow

### ✅ No Critical Issues Found

- API authentication working
- Workflow permissions correct
- PR creation successful
- Issue commenting functional

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Workflow Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: No workflow run after adding `auto-develop` label
**Causes**:
- Label name mismatch
- Workflow permissions issue
- Branch protection rules

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check label exists
gh label list | grep auto-develop

# Verify workflow file
cat .github/workflows/ai-develop.yml

# Manual trigger
gh workflow run ai-develop.yml -f issue_number=XX
```

#### Issue: API Authentication Failed
**Symptoms**: Workflow fails with "API key not set" error
**Causes**:
- Missing GitHub secret
- Incorrect secret name
- Expired API key

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check secrets
gh secret list

# Set secret
gh secret set TOGETHER_API_KEY

# Verify in workflow logs
gh run view --log
```

#### Issue: No Code Generated
**Symptoms**: PR created but contains only summary file
**Causes**:
- Issue description too complex
- Token limit exceeded
- Model timeout

**Solutions**:
1. Break issue into smaller, focused tasks
2. Provide more specific requirements
3. Use structured issue template
4. Try different AI provider

#### Issue: Incomplete Implementation
**Symptoms**: Generated code missing key functionality
**Causes**:
- Complexity exceeds single-shot generation
- Dependencies not clear
- Ambiguous requirements

**Solutions**:
1. Create follow-up issues for missing parts
2. Provide code examples in issue
3. Use incremental approach
4. Manual completion + AI assistance

   - Test each component independently
   - Combine later

3. **AI Provider Selection**
   ```
   Simple tasks: Together.ai (fast, cheap)
   Complex logic: Anthropic Claude (better reasoning)
   Large context: OpenAI GPT-4 (32K context)
   ```

4. **Quality Control**
   - Always review AI-generated code
   - Run tests locally before merging
   - Check for security issues
   - Validate against requirements
