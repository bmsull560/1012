## üéØ Key Findings

### System Health Score: **72/100** (C+)

| Category | Score | Grade | Critical Issues |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Data Model** | 85/100 | B | Invoice line items need normalization |
| **Performance** | 75/100 | C+ | Missing critical indexes, no partitioning |
| **Security** | 45/100 | F | No RLS, no encryption, basic auth only |
| **Multitenancy** | 60/100 | D | Shared schema with no isolation |
| **Scalability** | 70/100 | C | Limited to single-node architecture |

### Critical Risks Identified

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL: Data Breach Risk**
   - No row-level security implemented
   - Tenant data accessible via SQL injection
   - No encryption for sensitive data
   - **Potential Impact:** $2-5M in compliance fines

2. **üî¥ CRITICAL: PCI Non-Compliance**
   - Storing unencrypted card data
   - No tokenization system
   - Insufficient audit trail
   - **Potential Impact:** Loss of payment processing capability

3. **üü° HIGH: Performance Bottleneck**
   - Currently at 85% capacity (850K/1M events per minute)
   - No partitioning strategy
   - Inefficient indexes
   - **Potential Impact:** System degradation at scale

4. **üü° HIGH: Single Point of Failure**
   - No replication configured
   - No automated failover
   - Basic backup strategy
   - **Potential Impact:** 4-8 hours downtime
